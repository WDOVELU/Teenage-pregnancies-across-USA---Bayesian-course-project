# Teenage pregnanciesacross the United States (Bayesian_Statistics_Project_2020Fall)
This is part of a project in Bayesian Statistics at Politecnico di Milano fall of 2020. Here you will find the main code and data that is used for our analysis and a PDF summarizing the entire work.

The project is based on two steps, first Time series analysis from bayesian view and then Spatio-Temporal analysis based on CARBayesST package. 

Our dataset is made out of observations across 50 States of America, over 29 years (1990-2018) for 2 separate age groups: 
+ girls aged 15-17, also called high-school group 
+ girls aged 18-19, also called post high-school group.   
This counts for a total of 50x29x2 = 2900 observations of Birth rates.
